Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

I chose the projects that had me write in morse code when i hit a certain button, and also had me just blink the lights. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think that I did a good job in commenting and in just getting the code to function properly

Where could you improve?

Once I learn more about embedded systems, I think I could improve on cleaning up the code and simplyfying it. I might have taken a harder route since I have never used c before.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I will keep github close to my side as well as stack overflow because they were both helpful in answering questions I had when I started to feel stuck

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The self research I had to do in order to make sure that I was doing the project correctly was helpful so I think if I maintain that motivation I will be good in future courses

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made sure to include comments to let any viewer know what my intent was through out the code, and I also maintianed uniformity in the code as well in terms of spacing, camelcasing, and more.
